# Changelog

## v0.20.1 — the macOS download

A signed, notarised **`Collie-arm64.dmg`** now ships alongside `Collie-Setup.exe`: double-click,
drag to Applications, done. No Python, no terminal, no Gatekeeper warning.

The bundle already existed; it did not work, and every check it had said it did.

- **Compiled extensions could not load.** The bundled interpreter is the process, so it is what
  library validation judges, and it was signed with the hardened runtime and no entitlements —
  `onnxruntime`, `tokenizers` and all of `pyobjc` failed to import. Semantic memory silently
  degraded to keyword search. Now 10/10 import.
- **The signature broke on first launch.** `.pyc` was stripped as build detritus; a signed `.app`
  is sealed, so the first run wrote 242 of them back and Gatekeeper began refusing the app *on the
  user's machine*. Bytecode is precompiled into the bundle, and the launcher cannot write to it.
- **The disk image was unsigned.** It notarised, stapled, and `stapler validate` reported success
  on a file nobody could open — only `spctl` tells you. The dmg is signed before notarisation now.
- **The build asks Gatekeeper for a verdict** and exits non-zero if it is refused. `codesign
  --verify` passes happily on all three failures above.
- **Releases are arm64 only**, and cross-building is refused rather than silently producing a
  payload that cannot be smoke-tested on the machine that built it.

## v0.18.0 — first public release

- **One-click Windows installer** (`Collie-Setup.exe`) — bundles a self-contained runtime
  (Python + Collie + semantic memory), the native desktop window, and the browser bridge.
  No Python, no terminal, no configuration.
- **Verification gate (`assert-verify`)** — Collie writes a reproduction that must fail on
  the broken code, makes the smallest edit that flips it, and re-runs the assertion before a
  task is called done.
- **Terminal-first, editor-anywhere** — `collie` (TUI), `collie web` (browser GUI with the
  live gate, diffs, and settings), and `collie acp` for Zed / JetBrains / neovim / VS Code
  over the Agent Client Protocol.
- **Local-first & model-agnostic** — bring your own subscription or API key (Anthropic,
  OpenAI-compatible presets, Ollama), or run fully local. No account, no telemetry.
- **Built in** — hybrid semantic memory, `code_search`, keyless web search, MCP support, a
  best-of-N `pack` mode, an autonomous `loop` that stops on a real green check, and a
  real-browser bridge that drives your logged-in Chrome/Edge.
